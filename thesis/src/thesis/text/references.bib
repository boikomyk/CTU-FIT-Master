The Cauchy mixture model is an attractive device to deal with both issues simultaneously. This paper develops an Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm to estimate the Cauchy mixture parameters.

However, this assumption is often violated in practice, as the conditions vary from node to node and are usually only partially known. In addition, the model may generally be too complicated, computationally demanding or even completely intractable. In this contribution, we propose a distributed ﬁltration framework based on the novel approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods, which is able to overcome these issues. In particular, we focus on ﬁltration in diffusion networks, where neighboring nodes share their observations and posterior distributions.},

This paper alleviates the assumption of a fully known and computationally tractable observation model. Exploiting the recent developments in the theory of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) filtration, an ABC counterpart of MPF is proposed, applicable when the observation model is too complex to be evaluated analytically or even numerically, but it is still possible to sample from it by plugging in the state. The novelty is 2-fold. First, ABC methods have not been used in marginalized filtering yet. Second, a new multivariate robust method for evaluation of particle weights is proposed. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the idea on the background of the MPF with a particular accent on exposition.},

As the practical implementation of ABC requires computations based on vectors of summary statistics, rather than full data sets, a central question is how to derive low-dimensional summary statistics from the observed data with minimal loss of information. In this article we provide a comprehensive review and comparison of the performance of the principal methods of dimension reduction proposed in the ABC literature. The methods are split into three nonmutually exclusive classes consisting of best subset selection methods, projection techniques and regularization. In addition, we introduce two new methods of dimension reduction. The first is a best subset selection method based on Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, and the second uses ridge regression as a regularization procedure. We illustrate the performance of these dimension reduction techniques through the analysis of three challenging models and data sets.},

	abstract = {Summary. Many modern statistical applications involve inference for complex stochastic models, where it is easy to simulate from the models, but impossible to calculate likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate ABC analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

The level of mathematics used is such that most material is accessible to readers with knowledge of advanced calculus. In particular, no knowledge of abstract measure theory is assumed, and the emphasis throughout is on statistical concepts rather than rigorous mathematics.

These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population.

	abstract = {Mathematics is playing an ever more important role in the physical and biological sciences, provoking a blurring of boundaries between scientific disciplines and a resurgence of interest in the modem as well as the classical techniques of applied mathematics. This renewal of interest,both in research and teaching, has led to the establishment of the series: Texts in Applied Mathematics (TAM). The developmentof new courses is a natural consequenceof a high level of excite ment on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as numerical and symbolic computersystems,dynamicalsystems,and chaos, mix with and reinforce the tradi tional methods of applied mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet the current and future needs of these advances and encourage the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish textbookssuitable for use in advancedundergraduate and begin ning graduate courses, and will complement the Applied Mathematical Seiences (AMS) series, which will focus on advanced textbooks and research level mono graphs. Preface Tbe purpose of this preface is twofold. Firstly, to give an informal historical in troduction to the subject area of this book, Systems and Control , and secondly, to explain the philosophy of the approach to this subject taken in this book and to outline the topics that will be covered.},

The software has been instrumental in raising awareness of Bayesian modelling among both academic and commercial communities internationally, and has enjoyed considerable success over its 20-year life span. Despite this, the software has a number of shortcomings and a principal aim of this paper is to provide a balanced critical appraisal, in particular highlighting how various ideas have led to unprecedented flexibility while at the same time producing negative side effects. We also present a historical overview of the BUGS project and some future perspectives. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this book, Andrew Harvey sets out to provide a unified and comprehensive theory of structural time series models. Unlike the traditional ARIMA models, structural time series models consist explicitly of unobserved components, such as trends and seasonals, which have a direct interpretation. As a result the model selection methodology associated with structural models is much closer to econometric methodology. The link with econometrics is made even closer by the natural way in which the models can be extended to include explanatory variables and to cope with multivariate time series. From the technical point of view, state space models and the Kalman filter play a key role in the statistical treatment of structural time series models. The book includes a detailed treatment of the Kalman filter. This technique was originally developed in control engineering, but is becoming increasingly important in fields such as economics and operations research. This book is concerned primarily with modelling economic and social time series, and with addressing the special problems which the treatment of such series poses. The properties of the models and the methodological techniques used to select them are illustrated with various applications. These range from the modellling of trends and cycles in US macroeconomic time series to to an evaluation of the effects of seat belt legislation in the UK.},

This article is about the lead up to Kalman's work, key discoveries in the development and maturation of the filter, a sampling of its many applications in aerospace, and recognition of some who played key roles in that history.},

	abstract = {A nonlinear differential equation of the Riccati type is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal filtering error. The solution of this “variance equation” completely specifies the optimal filter for either finite or infinite smoothing intervals and stationary or nonstationary statistics. The variance equation is closely related to the Hamiltonian (canonical) differential equations of the calculus of variations. Analytic solutions are available in some cases. The significance of the variance equation is illustrated by examples which duplicate, simplify, or extend earlier results in this field. The Duality Principle relating stochastic estimation and deterministic control problems plays an important role in the proof of theoretical results. In several examples, the estimation problem and its dual are discussed side-by-side. Properties of the variance equation are of great interest in the theory of adaptive systems. Some aspects of this are considered briefly.},

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},
